## üîß Environment Variables Setup

### Backend (.env file)
Add these variables to your backend `.env` file:

```bash
# Razorpay Configuration (REQUIRED)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id           # Get from Razorpay Dashboard
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret             # Get from Razorpay Dashboard  
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret     # Optional for webhook verification

# Payment Plan Configuration (NEW)
PLAN_DURATION_DAYS=365                          # Plan validity in days (default: 365)
PAYMENT_VALID_DAYS=365                          # Payment link validity (default: 365)
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com         # Super admin email for notifications

# Other existing variables...
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Registration Flow (4 Steps):

1. **Company Information** - Basic company details and logo upload
2. **Admin Account** - Admin user creation 
3. **Email Verification** - Dual OTP verification:
   - Admin email OTP verification
   - Company contact email OTP verification (if different)
4. **Payment** - Razorpay integration for ‚Çπ20,000 registration fee

### Dual OTP System:
- Generates separate OTPs for admin email and company contact email
- If emails are identical, only verifies admin OTP
- Both emails must be verified before proceeding to payment

### Payment Integration:
- Fixed amount: ‚Çπ20,000 (configurable in backend/config/payment.js)
- Supports: Credit/Debit Cards, UPI, Net Banking, Wallets
- Secure Razorpay integration with signature verification
- Payment verification and company activation on success

### New Advanced Features:

#### üîí Login Restrictions:
- Users cannot login if company payment is not completed
- Automatic plan expiry checking on login attempts
- Clear error messages with payment links for pending payments

#### üîó Payment Link Sharing:
- Standalone payment page accessible via: `/payment/{companyCode}`
- Share payment links for companies that completed registration but not payment
- API endpoint: `GET /api/companies/payment-link/{companyCode}`

#### üìÖ Plan Management:
- Configurable plan duration (default: 365 days)
- Automatic plan start/end date calculation
- Plan expiry checking and account suspension

#### üìß Automated Email System:
- **Payment Success**: Sent to company contact email with plan details
- **Super Admin Notifications**: Sent to configured admin email for each payment
- **Plan Expiry Reminders**: Automated reminders 5 days and 1 day before expiry
- **Expiry Notifications**: Immediate notification when plan expires

#### ‚è∞ Automated Reminder System:
- Cron job runs daily at 9:00 AM (Indian timezone)
- Automatic detection of companies needing reminders
- Prevents duplicate reminders with smart tracking
- Automatic account suspension for expired plans

## üîó Key API Endpoints

### Company Registration & OTP:
- `POST /api/companies/register` - Company registration with dual OTP sending
- `POST /api/companies/verify-dual-otp` - Verify both admin and contact OTPs
- `GET /api/companies/payment-link/:companyCode` - Get payment link for company

### Payment:
- `GET /api/payments/config` - Get payment configuration
- `POST /api/payments/create-order` - Create Razorpay order
- `POST /api/payments/verify` - Verify payment after completion
- `GET /api/payments/status/:companyCode` - Get payment status

### Authentication:
- `POST /api/companies/login` - Login with payment validation
  - Returns 402 status for pending payments with payment link
  - Returns 402 status for expired plans

## üé® Frontend Components

### RegisterCompanyPage.js
- Multi-step registration form
- Dual OTP input handling
- PaymentGateway integration
- Responsive design with animations

### PaymentGateway.js  
- Professional payment UI
- Multiple payment method options
- Razorpay integration
- Success/failure handling

## üöÄ Getting Razorpay Credentials

1. Sign up at [https://razorpay.com](https://razorpay.com)
2. Go to Account & Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Generate Test/Live keys
4. Add to your .env file:
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` - Public key (starts with rzp_test_ or rzp_live_)
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` - Secret key
   - `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook verification (optional)

## üìß Email Configuration

Current setup uses Gmail SMTP:
- Host: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- Email: a.dineshsundar02@gmail.com
- Password: App-specific password (configured)

## üîß Testing the Implementation

1. **Install missing dependency:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install razorpay@^2.9.4
   ```

2. **Configure Razorpay credentials in .env**

3. **Test registration flow:**
   - Go to `/register-company`
   - Complete all 4 steps
   - Verify dual OTP functionality  
   - Test payment with Razorpay test cards

4. **Test payment with Razorpay test cards:**
   - Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   - CVV: Any 3 digits
   - Expiry: Any future date

## üîÑ Payment Configuration

Amount can be modified in `backend/config/payment.js`:
```javascript
REGISTRATION_FEE: 2000000, // ‚Çπ20,000 in paise (20000 * 100)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

1. **Razorpay initialization fails:**
   - Check RAZORPAY_KEY_ID and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET in .env
   - Ensure values don't have extra spaces or quotes

2. **OTP emails not sending:**
   - Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD
   - Check Gmail app password configuration

3. **Payment verification fails:**
   - Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible
   - Check signature verification in payment controller

## üìã Next Steps

1. Add Razorpay credentials to .env file
2. Test the complete registration flow
3. Configure webhook URL in Razorpay dashboard (optional)
4. Deploy and test in production environment

## üîí Security Notes

- Payment verification uses cryptographic signature validation
- OTPs expire after 10 minutes
- All payment data is encrypted in transit
- No sensitive payment information is stored locally

**Implementation is complete and ready for testing with proper environment variables configured!**
